/**
 * Calls $fn with $args and returns its results.
 *
 * This function tries to solve the problem of calling a function stored in a class attribute, because if you try
 * `$this->callable($arg1, $arg2)` PHP expects `$this->callable` to be a function and not a property. And to avoid
 * use the magic method _invoke_ that will properly work `$this->callable->__invoke($arg1, $arg2)` we use go with
 * `apply($this->callable, [$arg1, $arg2])`.
 *
 * Be aware that using this function most IDEs will lose the path, so they will not detect that your are passing the
 * wrong number of parameters or will not do as you expect a change of signature. To have a good test suite would be a
 * requirement for a widely use of this function in your code.
